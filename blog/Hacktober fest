This site and GitHub repo are here to showcase all of the amazing companies that go above and beyond by offering their own swag for the holiday. The goal of this project is to connect contributors to open-source projects that they might not have heard about before and drive traffic towards organizations that celebrate Hacktoberfest and can use a little more help.

This website/repo is not about collecting all of the swag you can. It is about the open-source community and highlighting organizations that purposely want to drive traffic to their projects during Hacktoberfest by offering unique swag
Swag is an added benefit of helping out these awesome organizations, not the reason for you to contribute in the first place
Participating in Hacktoberfest requires following the official values, including not spamming the participating companies.
