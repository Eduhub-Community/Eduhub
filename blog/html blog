Editor is a template you can use to make a simple HTML blog. But don't take simple to mean basic. Editor has an eye-catching minimal design and helpful features for you.

The layout is made to keep the focus on your content and to limit distractions. There's a featured post slider, so visitors can see star posts as soon as they land on your home page. This blog HTML template also has responsive design so users can have a great browsing experience on any screen size.
